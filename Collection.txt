2) Hash set - data in unsorted order.

Tree Set - If u are using TreeSet then implements Comparable and override compareTo() for sorting and unique object...
comparable - it is needed in TreeSet.
	compareTo() method is use to check the equality of two objects.

hashcode and euals() method is very very important for Interview point of view.
